This command helps you craft meaningful, well-structured commit messages.
You'll be guided through a series of prompts to describe:
  🔧 Type of change (Feature, Bug fix, etc.)
  ✏️  What was changed
  💡 Why it was changed
  📍 Scope of impact
  ⚠️  Any breaking changes

Let’s make your commit history beautiful and informative! 🚀`,
	// Uncomment the following line if your bare application
	// has an action associated with it:
	// Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) { },
}

// Execute adds all child commands to the root command and sets flags appropriately.
// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.
func Execute() {
	err := rootCmd.Execute()
	if err != nil {
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}

func init() {
	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.
	// Cobra supports persistent flags, which, if defined here,
	// will be global for your application.

	// rootCmd.PersistentFlags().StringVar(&cfgFile, "config", "", "config file (default is $HOME/.gommit.yaml)")

	// Cobra also supports local flags, which will only run
	// when this action is called directly.
