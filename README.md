##  Git Assistant CLI

A lightweight command-line tool to help you interact with Git more easily. Built with [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra), this assistant provides quick access to common Git tasks like checking the current branch, viewing the latest commit, and getting the remote URL.

### ‚ú® Features

- Show current branch name  
- Display latest commit info  
- Get remote repository URL  
- Count total commits in the current branch  
- Generate **AI-powered commit messages** for your changes  
- Get detailed repository status (staged, unstaged, untracked files)  


###  Installation

Clone the repo and build the binary:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/llyas36/gommit.git
cd gommit
go build -o gommit
```
Make it globally accessible (Optional)

If you want to use GOMMIT from anywhere in your terminal, move it to a directory in your $PATH:
```
sudo mv gommit /usr/local/bin/
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

To enable the **AI-powered commit messages**, you‚Äôll need an API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai).

1. **Get an API key**  
   - Sign up at [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai).  
   - Generate a new API key from your dashboard.

2. **Export your API key as an environment variable**  

   ```bash
   export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

3. ** Model used
   - GOMMIT uses the following model for commit message generation
  ```bash
  cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mistral-24b-venice-edition:free
``` 

### üõ† Usage

Use GOMMIT commands in your Git repositories to quickly get information or perform tasks:

```bash
./gommit branch     # Show the current Git branch
./gommit commit     # Generate an AI-powered commit message or perform commits
./gommit info       # Get detailed repository info (repository, origin, last commit, total commit)
./gommit status     # Display the latest status 
./gommit git        # Check if the current directory is a Git repository
```
If you installed GOMMIT globally with go install, you can just run:
```
gommit branch
gommit commit
gommit info
gommit status
gommit git
```
